        Hi, my name is Al.
        \n\nI love pork.
        \n\nThe kind of eats dirty food and its own shit.
        \n\nFun fact is that I look like a pork, a cute one of course.
        \n\nAside from pork I love chicken and beef. Steak in medium rare.
        \n\nI go to Instagram sometimes and enjoy watching chiefs cook different kinds of meat.
        \n\nMy ultimate dream is to be able to try A5+ Wagyu Steak
        \n\nI love fitness too but I love food more.
        \n\nFood is love and I can never blame it for keep me out of weight because food is equal to happiness.
